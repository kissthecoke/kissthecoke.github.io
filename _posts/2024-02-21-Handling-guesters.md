Most applications include some form of user interaction with the system. The first step in building an interactive application is to detect input gestures. See how that works by creating a simple button:

The [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) widget doesnâ€™t have a visual representation but instead detects gestures made by the user. When the user taps the [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html), the `GestureDetector` calls its [`onTap()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html#onTap) callback, in this case printing a message to the console. You can use `GestureDetector` to detect a variety of input gestures, including taps, drags, and scales.

Many widgets use a [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) to provide optional callbacks for other widgets. For example, the [`IconButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html), [`ElevatedButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html), and [`FloatingActionButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FloatingActionButton-class.html) widgets have [`onPressed()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html#onPressed) callbacks that are triggered when the user taps the widget.
