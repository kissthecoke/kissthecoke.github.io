Flutter provides a number of widgets that help you build apps that follow Material Design. A Material app starts with the [`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html) widget, which builds a number of useful widgets at the root of your app, including a [`Navigator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html), which manages a stack of widgets identified by strings, also known as “routes”. The `Navigator` lets you transition smoothly between screens of your application. Using the [`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html) widget is entirely optional but a good practice.
